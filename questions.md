 <p>Question 3:</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Time sharing as the logical extension of multi-programming provides following advantages: </span></p> 
 <p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Due to the frequent and quick switches between the multiple jobs executed concurrently by the CPU, user interaction with the computer system can be provided and the user isn’t even aware of the switching between multiple jobs (only if short response time can be enabled).</span></p> 
 <p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Time-sharing is beneficial when multiple users share the computer simultaneously. Due to short commands and rapidly switches between the jobs, each user thinks that the whole system is only dedicated to his or her work. Each user's processes receive a fair share of CPU-computation time --&gt; this is why this method is called time-sharing.</span></p>
 <p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Since processes usually require soon I/O-interaction with the user and this I/O is normally only as quick as the user his or herself (ie. typing speed), the CPU would have to wait, which is very inefficient. To perform more efficiently, the operating systems in time-shared systems will let the CPU quickly switch to other users' processes, if the CPU would have to sit idle and wait for the result of the interaction.<br></span></p> 
 <p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Via virtual memory used as a method to enable reasonable response time in time-shared system, users can run programs that need more storage than actually is provided by physical memory. </span></p> 
 <p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Time shared system further provide means for protecting its resources from inappropriate use. </span></p>

 <p>The main advantages of time-sharing are:</p>
 <p>1. Speed</p>
 <p>The CPU is able to execute multiple jobs at the same time by switching between jobs. These switches take place so fast that the user is not able to recognize that. Due to these fast switches the user is able to interact with several programs while they are running.</p>

 <p></p>
 <p>A trap is a special kind of interrupt and&nbsp;is an&nbsp;exception in a user process ie it's&nbsp;caused by invalid memory access or division by zero. It can also be used to invoke a kernel routine (a system call) as these run with a higher priority than user code.&nbsp;&nbsp;With Traps the handling is&nbsp;synchronous (so the user code is temporarily suspended and continues afterwards) and they are essentially&nbsp;"active" most of the time as the code expects the trap to happen and relies on this</p>
 <p>&nbsp;Whereas with hardware generated interrupts (devices like the hard disk etc) the handling is asynchronous (which means they don't happen at predictable places in the user code) so they are essentially "passive" since the interrupt handler has to wait for them to happen. Hardware generated interrupts "interrupt" the normal control flow, as the CPU has to switch to the driver routine to handle the event.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>The reason for both events?</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p>A hardware interrupt is a program control interruption which is based on an external hardware event that is external to the CPU for example a mouse click or keyboard instruction. </p>
 <p></p>
 <p>A trap is commonly referred to as a software interrupt and is an exception in a user process and it's&nbsp;caused by invalid memory access or division by zero but cannot be triggered by external hardware like the hardware interrupt.</p>

<div class="posting fullpost">
 <p>UMA and NUMA are important when it comes to multiprocessor systems. Such systems have begun to dominate the landscape of computing. They have two or more processors in close communication, sharing infrastructure components (e.g. computer bus, sometimes clock, memory and peripheral devices).</p>
 <p>Multiprocessing adds CPUs to increase computing power. If the CPU has an integrated memory controller, then adding CPUs might increase the amount of memory which is adressable in the system. Either way, multiprocessing can cause a system to change its memory access model from uniform memory access (UMA) to non-uniform memory access (NUMA).</p>
 <p>UMA is defined as the situation in which access to any RAM from any CPU takes the same amount of time.</p>

<div class="posting fullpost">
 <p>There are three forms of memory. One is rewritable and is usually called main memory or RAM (random-access memory). It is used for most programs on general computers. For static programs such as bootstrap the computer uses ROM ( read only memory). The third one is EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory), which can be changed but cannot be changed frequently so it is common that it contains static programs.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>All forms of memory provide an array of bytes where each byte has its own address. A load instruction moves a word/byte from the main memory to the internal register, which is in the CPU, when meanwhile a store instruction moves the content to a register in main memory. Besides these loads and stores the CPU loads instruction directly from main memory for execution.<br></p>

 <p>The first type of memory is <b>RAM</b> (random-access memory). It is also called main memory and is rewritable. This is the part general-purpose computer run most of their programs from.

 <p>All those forms of memory provide an array of bytes with an individual address for every byte. There are two types of instruction to a specific memory address: <b>load</b> and <b>store</b>. The <i>load</i>-instruction moves a byte or a word from the main memory into an internal register within the CPU. The <i>store-</i>instruction works the other way round: it moves the content of an internal register into the main memory.

On the one hand, it uses the “<b>load</b>”-instruction to move a byte from the main memory to an internal register. On the other hand, it utilizes the explicit “<b>store</b>”-function in order to move content from internal registers to main memory.

<div class="posting fullpost">
 <p>The idea of multiprogramming says that the operating system initially keeps several jobs in memory simultaneously. These jobs are kept on the disk in the job pool, as the main memory is to small to accommodate all jobs. The operating system picks and begins to execute one of the jobs in memory. Sometimes the job needs to wait for some task, such as an I/O operation, to complete. <br></p>

 <p>Multiprogramming increases the utilization of the CPU by keeping all the jobs in a job pool on the disk. If one job can't be done immediately (e. g. beause of missing information from I-/O-Devices) the CPU can do another job from the job pool and is not idling.</p>

 In the Dual-mode operation, we must be able to distinguish between the execution of the operating system codes and user defined codes.&nbsp;

 <span style="color:rgb(102,102,102);font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:1.5em;">. These are the two kind of operations. The difference is in whose code needs to be executed.</span>
 <p><span style="color:rgb(102,102,102);font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:1.5em;">The operating system distinguished between these two modes by a so-called mode-bit, which indicates the current mode (kernel: 0, user: 1).</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:rgb(102,102,102);font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:1.5em;">When the system boots, it starts in kernel mode. When it loads user applications, it switches to user mode. When an interrupt happens, it switches back again to kernel mode.</span></p>

 <p>Thanks a lot for your answers! You´ve already mentioned everything important, but I´ll try to sum it up a little:</p>
 <p>-&gt; We differentiate between Kernel mode and user mode.</p>
 <p>-&gt; In Kernel mode, we have unrestricted access to the underlying hardware. It is for example used when the system starts or when an interrupt happens.<br>In User mode, the executing code is not allowed to access hardware or reference memory directly. Systems are in user mode as long as the user uses something.</p>
 <p>-&gt; Having two different modes of operation is kind of a protection because it prevents us and our applications to accidently overwrite parts of hardware and memory, but gives us the opportunity to do so if necessary.<br></p>

###  <p>Name and describe the main advantages of Multiprocessor systems.<br></p>
 <div class="attachedimages"></div>
</div>

<div class="posting fullpost">
 <p>The main advantages of multiprocessor systems are:</p>
 <p>&gt; <b>Increased throughput</b></p>
 <p>If we have more processors, we can get more work done in less time. But it is important, to keep in mind, that the speed doesn´t increase proportionally to the numbers of processors, because several processors cooperating on a task, require a certain amount of overhead keeping all parts working correctly. In addition, contention for shared resources lowers the expected gain from additional processors.</p>
 <p>======================================</p>
 <p>Ein System mit mehreren Prozessoren kann in derselben Zeit mehr Arbeit bewältigen. Allerdings ist das Verhältnis zwischen der Anzahl an Prozessoren und damit der Rechenleistung nicht proportional zur Geschwindigkeit: Zwei Prozessoren arbeiten nicht doppelt so schnell wie einer, sondern irgendwo dazwischen. Dies liegt zum Einen daran, dass ein Teil der Kapazität dazu benötigt wird, die verschiedenen Teile zu koordinieren und zum Anderen daran, dass einige Ressourcen von den Prozessoren geteilt werden.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>&gt; <b>Economy of scale</b></p>
 <p>Multiprocessor systems might be less expensive than equivalent multiple single-processor systems (one N-processor is cheaper than N one-processors), because they can share peripherals, mass storage and power supplies.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>&gt; <b>Increased reliability</b></p>
 <p>If functions are distributed between the processors, the failure of one processor just slows down the whole process, but doesn´t turn into a failure.<br></p>

 <p>Here is an additional question, because other students already posed the first one earlier. If you want you can answer this one too.</p>
 <p>What is a system-call interface? Describe its functionality briefly.<br></p>
 <div class="attachedimages"></div>
</div>
---

<div class="posting fullpost">
 A system-call interface is a link to system calls made available by the operating system. It intercepts function calls in the application programming interface and invokes the necessary system call within the operating system. It is needed because most of the details of the operating system interfaces are hidden from the programmer by the API. Therefore most programming languages provide this so-called system call interface.
 <div class="attachedimages"></div>
</div>

<div class="posting fullpost">
 The operating system enables a system-call interface which serves as link to system calls. It intercepts function calls in the API and invokes the necessary system calls within the operating system. Typically, a number is associated with each system call and the system-call interface maintains a table indexed according to these numbers. It then invokes the intended system call in the operating-system kernel and returns the status of the system call and any return values. Most of the details of the operating-system interface are hidden from the programmer by the API. 
 <br>
 <div class="attachedimages"></div>
</div>
---

<div class="posting fullpost">
 <p>You already mentioned all relevant facts. It was important to point out the functionality of the system-call interface as a link to different basic operations performed by the kernel. These operations should not visible or accessible for the programmer directly but are executed when using and performing specific methods or functions in processes. For example:</p>
 <p>If you implementing a method to read a file then you might use a function called '*.read("filedirectory")' (depending on the programming language). The content of this method is normally not accessible or visible for the programmer (also a debugger might not have access). Within this method there might be probably several other function calls but at least one which invokes a read function in kernel mode. The system-call interface allows the programmer not to know each kernel-operation and also restrict the access to them to prevent the operating system, data stored on the machine and the computer itself from inconsistent or harmful combinations of kernel-operations which might cause problems.<br></p>

<div class="posting fullpost">
 <h3><b>Answer: </b></h3>The six major categories of system calls are: Process Control, File Manipulation, Device Manipulation, Information Maintenance ,Communications and Protection.
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>Information Maintenance:</b>&nbsp; Information Maintenance are System Calls transferring information between the user program and the operating system. Examples for this are the call time() for returning the current time, calls for returning the number of current users ore the version number of the operating System. 
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>Protection:</b> Protection Calls provides the access control to the resources provided by a computer System. The Networking of computers and the Internet make it necessary to concern every computer device with protection. Examples for System calls are allow_user() and deny_user(). This calls specify witch user can ore not access to certain resources.

 <p>Great!&nbsp;<span style="line-height:1.5em;">I don't have anything to add to your answers.</span></p>
 <p>But to complete my own question, I'll briefly explain the other two categories:<br></p>
 <p><span><b>Process Control:</b></span></p>
 <p>A running program needs to be able to halt its execution either normally or abnormally. If a system call is made to terminate the currently running program abnormally, or if the program runs into a problem and causes an error tap, a dump of memory is sometimes taken and an error message generated. The dump is written to disk and may be examined by a debugger to determine the cause of the problem.&nbsp;<br>Under either normal and abnormal circumstances, the operating system must transfer control to the invoking command interpreter. The command interpreter then reads the next command.&nbsp;</p>

 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span><b>Communication:<br></b></span></p>

 <p style="margin:5px 0px;padding:0px 0px 5px;font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;line-height:1.5em;color:rgb(102,102,102);"><span>In the&nbsp;<b>message-passing model</b>, the communicating processes exchange messages (direcly or indirectly) with one another to transfer information.

Normally, the operating system tries to prevent one process from accessing another process's memory. Shared memory requires that two or more processes agree to remove this restriction. They can then exchange information by reading and writing data in the shared areas.</span></p>

Alternatively a table whose entries point to interrupt routines can be used for increased speed. Stored in low memory, and accessed using a unique device number, the so called interrupt vector quickly provides the matching address for the service routine. Since after processing of the interrupt, the CPU resumes to its prior computation, the interrupt architecture also has to take care of saving the interrupted instruction’s address. The current state of the processor in the moment the signal arrived has to be saved and restored again, if the interrupt procession requires to change the processor state. Having finished interrupt procession, the program counter is set to the saved address, kept state is restored and the CPU can continues executing the prior computation.</span></p>

###  <p>Question: Describe briefly the principle of the Dual-Mode Operation and emphasize the advantages for systems with that feature.<br></p>
 <div class="attachedimages"></div>
</div>
---

<div class="posting fullpost">
 <p>The<b> Dual-Mode </b>aims at the <b>proper execution of the operating system</b>, which demands for a <b>distinguish between the execution</b> of <b>operating-system code</b> and <b>userdefined code</b>.</p>
 <p>At least, we need <b>two separate modes</b> of operation:<b> user mode</b> and <b>kernel mode</b>.&nbsp;A so-called <b>mode bit</b> is added to the hardware of the computer to <b>indicate the current mode</b>: kernel (0) or user (1). With this mode bit, we can see whether a program is executed on <b>behalf of the operating system</b> or the <b>user</b>. When the computer system is executing on behalf of a user application, the system is in <b>user mode</b>. When a user application <b>requests a service</b> from the operating system via a system call, the system <b>must transition</b> <b>from user to kernel mode</b> to perform the request.<br></p>
 <p><b>Protection</b> is ensured by designating some machine instructions that can cause harm as&nbsp;<b>privileged instructions. </b>They can <b>only be executed in kernel mode</b> and if an application in user mode attempts to execute privileged instructions, the <b>hardware does not execute</b> the request but rather treats it as <b>illegal</b> and<b> traps it to the operating system</b>. <b>Example</b> for a privileged instruction is to <b>switch to kernel mode</b>.</p>
 <p><b>Advantages</b>:</p>
 <p>1) <b>Protection of the Operating system</b>...</p>
 <p>- ... from errant users</p>
 <p>- ... from being&nbsp;wiped out by getting overwritten with data by an user application</p>
 <p>- ... by abnormally terminating illegal programs</p>

 <div class="attachedimages"></div>
</div>
---

<div class="posting fullpost">
 <p>Within the operating system there are 2 different modes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>First the kernel mode which has to be used for system operations&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And second the user mode which is being used for executing user generated code.</p>
 <p>To be able to differntiate between those two modes an indicator bit is being used to save the active mode (0 Kernel, 1 User). If the mode does not suit the upcoming operation, a mode switch has to be performed priorly in order to execute the code properly.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Advantages:</p>
 <p>The dual-mode saves the operating system from any unauthorized operations by user programs that could bring any harm.</p>
 <p>Aswell it prevents programs from generating conflicts through acessing the same memory space at the same time.</p>
 <p>Furthermore it can stop programs that would otherwise run endlessly</p>

<div class="posting fullpost">
 <p>The stack is the memory set aside as scratch space for a thread of execution. When a function is called, a block is reserved on the top of the stack for local variables and some bookkeeping data. When that function returns, the block becomes unused and can be used the next time a function is called. The stack is always reserved in a LIFO (last in first out) order; the most recently reserved block is always the next block to be freed. This makes it really simple to keep track of the stack; freeing a block from the stack is nothing more than adjusting one pointer.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The heap is memory set aside for dynamic allocation. Unlike the stack, there's no enforced pattern to the allocation and deallocation of blocks from the heap; you can allocate a block at any time and free it at any time. This makes it much more complex to keep track of which parts of the heap are allocated or free at any given time; there are many custom heap allocators available to tune heap performance for different usage patterns.</p>

 Thank you for your answers.
 <br>
 <br>The Answer(s) were not only briefly but are fare more detailed as needed!
 <br>
 <br>The most important points your should focus on are the following:
 <br>
 <br>Stack
 <br>
 <ul>
  <li>LiFo principe</li>
  <li>stores information/data for threads</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Heap</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Stores data and allows memory allocation for threads</li>
 </ul>
 <p>both work from different directions: If Stack reaches the edge of Heap an Exception occures! The Stackoverflow exception. Think about infinite Loops in this case.</p>

 <p>3. Thread Pools</p>
 <p>4. Thread-Specific Data</p>
 <p>5. Scheduler Activations</p>
 <p><b>6. Cancellation:</b></p>
 <p>Thread cancellation is when one thread is allowed to terminate the execution of any other thread (target thread) in the process.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>For example, if multiple threads are searching through a database and one find the result, it will then terminate all other threads also searching in the database.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There are two different types of thread cancellation: Asynchronous and Deferred.</p>
 <p>Asynchronous cancellation means that one thread immediately terminates the target thread.</p>
 <p>Deferred cancellation means that the target threads frequently checks if it should be terminated, allowing it an opportunity to terminate itself in an orderly fashion. The cancellation point is the safety point where a thread can be terminated after being checked to ensure no data will be lost.</p>

 <p>A zombie process is a process in Unix OS that has completed execution, but still has an entry in the process table. This process is an old child process that is executed, but it waits for the parent process to send a status, when the parent process get the status, the zombie process are killed. A zombie process directed himself no damage.</p>

<div class="posting fullpost">
 <p>On Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems, a zombie process or defunct process is a process that has completed execution (via the exit system call) but still has an entry in the process table: it is a process in the "Terminated state". This occurs for child processes, where the entry is still needed to allow the parent process to read its child's exit status: once the exit status is read via the wait system call, the zombie's entry is removed from the process table and it is said to be "reaped". A child process always first becomes a zombie before being removed from the resource table. In most cases, under normal system operation zombies are immediately waited on by their parent and then reaped by the system – processes that stay zombies for a long time are generally an error and cause a resource leak.<br></p>
